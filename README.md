Utilizing Python's data analysis libraries, including Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, this project explores a mall customer dataset to uncover insights through univariate analysis and clustering techniques. The initial steps involve descriptive statistics and visualization of key features such as age, annual income, and spending score. Univariate analysis includes histograms, KDE plots, and box plots, providing a comprehensive view of the dataset's distribution.

Gender distribution is analyzed, revealing more females than males in the dataset. Box plots further explore the relationship between gender and key features. Customer ID is dropped for streamlined analysis. A pairplot and correlation matrix offer a multivariate perspective on the dataset.

The project concludes with a focus on clustering using the KMeans algorithm. This involves univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, providing a holistic understanding of customer segments. The heatmap visually represents correlations, contributing to a robust exploration of the dataset's patterns. Overall, the project showcases a systematic approach to customer data analysis, blending statistical techniques and visualizations for actionable insights.
